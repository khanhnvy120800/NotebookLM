In some cases, overly broad summaries omitted finer details, but no hallucinations were observed. The summarisation speed was excellent.

### **Conclusion**  
NotebookLM summarisation is highly useful for condensing long readings into revision-ready material. It improves time efficiency without sacrificing clarity.
