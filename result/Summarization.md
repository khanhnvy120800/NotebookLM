### **Objectives**  
To test NotebookLM’s ability to summarise long and dense content into accurate and concise study material, especially useful when revising for a digital marketing exam.

---

### **Method**  
The user uploaded three sources:
- A 20-page case study on influencer marketing
- Lecture slides on marketing funnel strategies

NotebookLM’s summarisation feature was used to extract:
- Key marketing tactics
- Campaign results
- Definitions of core terms

We assessed:
- Summary accuracy
- Coverage of main points
- Clarity and coherence

---

### **Result**

NotebookLM generated clear and readable summaries that reflected the main points of each document. For example, the case study summary correctly identified campaign goals, influencer selection criteria, and KPI results.

In some cases, overly broad summaries omitted finer details, but no hallucinations were observed. The summarisation speed was excellent.

### **Conclusion**  
NotebookLM summarisation is highly useful for condensing long readings into revision-ready material. It improves time efficiency without sacrificing clarity.
