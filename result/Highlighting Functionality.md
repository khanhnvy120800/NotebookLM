# Experiment 2: Highlighting Functionality
### **Objectives**  
To assess how effectively NotebookLM supports active reading and organisation through its highlighting feature, particularly in an academic setting involving digital marketing exam preparation.

---

### **Method**  
The user uploaded digital marketing lecture slides and case study PDFs, then selected key concepts such as:
- "AIDA Model"
- "Google Ads Quality Score"
- "Email Click-Through Rates"

Highlighted text was analysed to determine whether NotebookLM correctly grouped and linked related information, making it easier to consolidate topics.

We focused on the following research questions:
- Are the highlights saved and traceable across documents?
- Does NotebookLM automatically connect similar highlighted topics from different sources?
- Can the student review all highlights under a thematic tag?

---

### **Result**

The highlighting tool worked smoothly, preserving selections across both PDF and Google Docs uploads. For example, highlighting “Google Ads” in one slide also linked to examples from case studies with related performance metrics.

NotebookLM auto-generated clustered notes under terms like "Ad Performance" and "Marketing Metrics," supporting quick topic review. Highlights were accessible from the sidebar and auto-linked to broader summaries.

---

### **Conclusion**  
The highlighting feature is highly effective for exam revision and content curation. It enhances focus and supports note organisation across multiple learning materials.
