# Experiment 3: Contextual Q&A Functionality
### **Objectives**  
To evaluate NotebookLM’s ability to provide accurate, source-based answers to user queries related to digital marketing concepts.

---

### **Method**  
Lecture content and textbook excerpts were uploaded, then questions were asked using plain English, such as:
- “What affects email open rates?”
- “How is ROI measured in digital marketing?”
- “What is the AIDA model?”

The goal was to verify:
- Whether responses were accurate and context-based
- If NotebookLM referenced the correct documents
- Whether the answers were concise and easy to understand

---

### **Result**

NotebookLM accurately extracted answers from uploaded lecture content. When asked about "ROI calculation," it generated an explanation that referenced both cost metrics and conversion tracking strategies.

Responses were context-sensitive and mostly free of hallucinations. The assistant was particularly strong at summarising models (e.g., AIDA, STP) from course notes.

---

### **Conclusion**  
NotebookLM’s Q&A feature functions well in an academic context, offering reliable support for concept reinforcement and exam preparation.
