## ✅ Conclusion

NotebookLM offers a promising set of tools for improving study efficiency, especially in summarising content and interactive Q&A. However, occasional content omissions and hallucination risks mean it should be used as a **support tool**, not a sole source of truth. Human validation is still essential in academic contexts.
